    <p class="motivationAnswer">We want to improve people's overall well-being. Since we <br>ourselves have struggled with mental health, we wanted to <br>find a way to help others
        in their journey of self-<br>improvement. Maintaining good mental health improves <br>physical health as well as productivity, social connections,<br>
        and reduces the risk of mental disorders. We want to help <br>people improve their quality of life because this not only <br>affects inividuals,
        but society as a whole.
